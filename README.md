  + [ ] Introductory material
    + [ ] What are actors? 10k foot view?
    + [ ] Primary benefits
      + isolation
      + scalability (through properties of time independence and location transparency)
      + dynamic construction / composition
      + ?? other topics ??
    + [ ] When to Use / Comparison
      + Compare the actor model as a form of concurrency against other primitives
        such as threads, futures, processes, etc.

  + [ ] Language specific frameworks
  + [ ] Podcasts? (there may not be enough content to warrant)
    + [ ] Programming Throwdown (ep82)

  + [ ] Advanced Topics (good to segment out information to avoid overwhelming newcomers)
    + [ ] Research papers (OG Hewitt&Baker paper + modern advancements)
    + [ ] Any good blog posts or talks about advanced topics (clustering, actor scheduling,
          patterns & practices, etc)
